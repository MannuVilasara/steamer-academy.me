          <p>
            At Code Club, we aim to cultivate children&apos;s love and curiosity
            for coding. Our clubs offer a fun and engaging environment for
            children to learn programming skills, develop problem-solving
            abilities, and unleash their creativity through coding projects. We
            believe that coding is an essential skill for the future, and
            we&apos;re here to make learning fun!

            What happens at a club?
          </h3>
          <p>
            At our Code Club sessions, young coders embark on exciting projects
            using the Scratch programming language, created by MIT. They learn
            to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations while
            developing computational thinking skills. Our sessions are guided by
            experienced mentors who provide support and encouragement, fostering
            a collaborative and fun learning environment.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is coding?</h3>
          <p>
            Coding, also known as computer programming, is the process of
            creating instructions that tell a computer what to do. It&apos;s
            like writing a recipe, but instead of cooking, you&apos;re telling a
            computer how to perform tasks or solve problems. Learning to code
            helps develop logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving
            skills - abilities that are valuable in many aspects of life and
            future careers.
